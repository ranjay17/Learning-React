# Task 16 - Lifting State Up in React

This task demonstrates the concept of "Lifting State Up" in React. It refers to the practice of moving state from a child component to a common parent component. The child sends data to the parent using callback functions passed via props, and the parent manages that state and can pass it to other components if needed. This helps in sharing and centralizing state between components.
