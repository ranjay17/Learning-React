# Task 11 - State and Event Handling

This task introduces basic interactivity in React using state and event handlers.

### âœ… Deliverables:

1. Added a `button` inside the `ExpenseItem` component to demonstrate interactivity.
2. Used the `useState` hook to manage and update the title dynamically when the button is clicked.
3. The button's `onClick` handler updates the title to `"New Title"` on click.

## Goal:
Understand how to use React's `useState` for dynamic content and wire up button click events to trigger state changes.
