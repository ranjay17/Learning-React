# Task 09 - Wrapper Components

This task demonstrates how to create and use a wrapper component in React.

### âœ… Deliverables:

1. A reusable `Card` component was created:
   - Accepts `className` as a prop and combines it with its own styling
   - Wraps `props.children` for reusable layout

2. The `Card` component is used inside `ExpenseItem` to wrap the content and provide consistent layout and styling.

3. A new CSS file `Card.css` was created to style the card layout.

## Goal:
To understand the concept of wrapper components in React, allowing for reusable and flexible UI building blocks.
